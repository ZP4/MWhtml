            At checkout, you will be prompted to choose a shipping method for your item(s). Shipping costs are based on the amount of items you are purchasing. Your total shipping charges will automatically compute during checkout prior to the completion of your order. For orders $750 and above, a signature will be required at the time of delivery.

            MatchWear ships only within the United States of America- Hawaii and Alaska included.

            Shipping: $8 USD

            Packing and Shipping
            When possible all items to the selected shipping address will be packaged together. Depending on the size of the item and number of units, orders may be packed and shipped in multiple boxes.

            Calculating Delivery Time
            Delivery Time = Processing Time + Wholesale Market Shipping Time + Shipping Time

            Wholesale Market Shipping Time refers to the amount of time it will take for the wholesale market to ship your order to us. (3 business days)

            Shipping Time is the amount of time it will take your order to ship once it has left our company.

            Total Maximum: 14-15 days
            Total Minimum: 8-9 days

            Shipping Rules & Restrictions
            Orders are shipped on business days only. Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United States.
            Upon delivery, a signature is required for orders that are $750 and above.
            The shipping cost displayed for an individual item reflects what you can expect to pay if the item ships alone. Your actual shipping and handling cost will automatically compute on the Shipping Options page of checkout.
            You will not be billed for items purchased with a credit card until the items have shipped. You may be billed for items purchased with a debit or bank card immediately upon order confirmation.
            Due to regulatory restrictions, we are unable to ship items made of exotic materials to California.
